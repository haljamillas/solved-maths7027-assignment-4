(a)

(b)

<ol start="2">

 <li>If possible, diagonalise the matrix</li>

</ol>

Make sure to check your answer (e.g. by verifying that <em>P</em><sup>−1</sup><em>AP </em>= <em>D</em>), this will be worth one mark.

<ol start="3">

 <li>Consider <em>X </em>∈R<em><sup>n</sup></em><sup>×<em>p </em></sup>for which we have performed a principal component analysis (PCA), that is let</li>

</ol>

<em>X </em>−<strong>1</strong><em><sub>n</sub></em><sub>×1</sub><strong>x</strong>¯ and  as usual. Suppose we are given another row of data which happens to be equal to <strong>x</strong>¯ so that we now have the data <em>Y </em>∈R<sup>(<em>n</em>+1)×<em>p </em></sup>which we can write as

How does the PCA of <em>Y </em>differ from that of <em>X</em>?
